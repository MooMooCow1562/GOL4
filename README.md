Hi, I'm Austin, and I'm going to attempt to improve my program when I have time for the sake of it.
Feel free to compile and run or edit my code as you see fit.

This is my first and currently (4/22/2025) most complex GUI implementation of Conway's game of life.
My second implementation is here: https://github.com/MooMooCow1562/AustinsUnityGameOfLife
